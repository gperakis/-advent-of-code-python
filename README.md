# Advent of Code in Python

This repository contains my solutions for Advent of Code programming puzzles.

More info about `Advent of Code` may be found
here: https://adventofcode.com/2021

All solutions are implemented in **Python**.

To run a solution use the `python -m` approach like the following

```bash
$ python -m day1
```

### Execution Times
